### I got over reddit in 2012.

Back then a good friend of mine suggested the online forum as a place to find information and funny pictures.

Started from a passive user, I instantly hooked up and created my account. Posting one or two things that I think people will be interested at.

At a point of time, I even made it into a top 200 reddit contributors by karma and even until now I am still actively posting things and even help moderating local community subreddit.


People ask me about the first and foremost thing that you have to do in the internet. The quote ["Remember the human"](https://redd.it/1ytp7q) is always be my words to live by.


'''Try to be courteous to others. See someone having a bad day? Give them a compliment or ask them a thoughtful question, and it might make their day better. Did someone reply to your comment with valuable insights or something that cheered you up? Send them a quick thanks letting them know you appreciate their comment.
'''

The second is keep yourself anonymous. "The identity of Reddit as a social networking site, a social news site, and a message board in addition to its affordances of _anonymity_..."[(2018, Kilgo, Ng & Riedl)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305118810216) So, be careful with what you shared online in Reddit. Different social media has different layout, format, and culture. Be **aware** that Reddit is not like Instagram, or Facebook. You don't want to be doxxed online, you just don't.

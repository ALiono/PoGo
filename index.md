On the contrary, [Pokémon GO revenue increased by 70% in March](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/06/02/coronavirus-boosts-pokmon-go-spending-by-70-as-gamers-play-inside/#1be886ef1994).

In addition, Pokemon Go also reduced the walking requirement for hatching eggs and Player Vs Player Battle. 

Pokémon GO has changed their business model to be more relevant with the COVID-19 situation. **Adapt, improvise, overcome.**
